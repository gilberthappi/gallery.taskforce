<!-- Features -->

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

### Key Features

- [ ] **Responsive Design**
>The interactive photo gallery should adapt seamlessly ✓

- [ ] **Figma Design Accuracy**
>Match the provided Figma designs pixel-perfectly,
including layout, spacing, typography, and visual styles ✓

- [ ] **Hover Interaction**
>Implement the hover interaction as shown in the Figma
prototype, displaying additional details when a user hovers over a photo ✓

- [ ] **Cross-browser Compatibility**
>Ensure consistent performance across
modern web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge ✓

- [ ] **Code Quality**
>Write clean, readable, and well-structured code, following
best practices and coding conventions for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ✓


### Challenge Solutions:

- [ ] **Subarray Sum Challenge**:

>The solution uses a sliding window technique to find a contiguous subarray that sums up to a given target.
>This approach ensures an O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, making it efficient for large inputs.
>Edge cases, such as an array with negative numbers or a target that cannot be achieved, are handled gracefully by the algorithm.

- [ ] **String Transformation Challenge**:

>The solution checks the divisibility of the string length by 3, 5, and 15 to determine the appropriate transformation.
>The operations of reversing the string and replacing characters with their ASCII codes are performed efficiently using built-in JavaScript methods.
>The solution ensures that all specified cases are handled correctly, and the implementation adheres to the expected time and space complexities.
